/**
 * Provides a lowercase view over another `FileSystem`:
 * - Contains only lowercase-named files.
 * - Effectively gives the user a case-insensitive view over a potentially case-sensitive filesystem.
 * - Caches the contents of the underlying filesystem. Call `refresh` to clear cache.
 * - Preserves empty folders that exist on the underlying FS, but also supports file systems that automatically prune
 *   empty folders.
 * - Conflicts are visible as empty files but are not readable / writeable / removeable (conflict is when both
 *   "file.txt" and "FILE.txt" exist).
 * - Is not thread-safe. Even const methods update the underlying cache.
 *
 * Some notes on why it is designed the way it is designed.
 *
 * Previous iteration was a writeable FS that was always up to date with the underlying FS (was checking timestamps for
 * all parents in each call). The code was messy, it was `O(N)` on each call, and even after writing an implementation
 * that actually worked, I hated it. Mostly because of the `O(N)` - which led to a recursive implementation of
 * `FileSystem::rename` becoming `O(N^2)`. It is possible to iron this out, but that would require to redo the
 * `FileSystem` interface & expose the `Directory` abstraction directly. Which is just not worth it.
 *
 * Next iteration was caching the whole file tree in constructor, but this was blowing up spectacularly when constructed
 * for `/`. Thus, we're now caching lazily.
 *
 * The important point about the implementation is that there is no amplification of the number of calls into the
 * underlying file system. Each of the methods in `LowercaseFileSystem` calls into the underlying file system at most
 * once.
