/**
 * Merges several filesystems into a single read-only view:
 * - Read operations go one by one over the underlying filesystems. This effectively means that files on filesystem #0
 *   will hide the files on filesystem #1 that have the same names.
 * - Folder contents are merged.
 * - The resulting view is kind of a Schrodinger's filesystem because it can contain files and folders with the same
 *   name.
 * - In case there is a file and a folder with the same name, `stat()` returns information for a file, so that it's
 *   possible to know its size. `ls()` will return both entries, in unspecified order.
 *
 * Some notes on why go Schrodingermaxxxing. When there is a conflict between underlying filesystems, and we have
 * a file and a folder with the same names, we have several different options:
 * 1. Only the file is visible.
 * 2. Only the folder is visible.
 * 3. Whichever is first in the filesystem list, is visible.
 * 4. Conflicting path is not visible through the merged filesystem at all.
 * 5. Schrodingermaxxx and make both visible.
 * 
 * When picking between the options, we must remember that:
 * a. A tree of merging filesystems should behave the same way as a single flattened merging filesystem.
 * b. Ideally, each method of the merging filesystem should call into each of the base filesystems at most once.
 * c. The behavior shouldn't be surprising.
 * 
 * Point #1 above fails (b) and (c). We can fix (b) by introducing a `walk()` method to `FileSystem` that would
 * return the longest existing prefix of a path, but then we're still left with the fact that behaviour is surprising.
 * 
 * Point #2 fails (c).
 * 
 * Point #3 fails (a), (b) and (c).
 * 
 * Point #4 fails (b), can be fixed in the same way as point #1. So, a viable option.
 * 
 * Point #5 satisfies all of the criteria, even though it's suffering a low-key bipolar disorder. So this is what we do.
